<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and
economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices
surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this
is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent
algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic
potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or
purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## 	:toolbox: Getting Started
 
<!-- Packages -->
### :bangbang: Packages

These are the packages used:

```bash
comet-ml==3.31.3
numpy 
random
matplotlib.pyplot 
pandas==1.3.5 
pickle
plotly
scikit-learn
scikit-surprise==1.1.1
string
spacy==3.2.4
```
Try the latest version on packages without versions

<!-- Installation -->
## :gear: Installation

Perhaps a package you may be unfamiliar with above is Surprise. Surprise is a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.

Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind:
- Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
- Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.

```bash
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scikit-surprise
Install comet-ml (in my case comet-ml==3.31.3)
```

<!-- Roadmap -->
## :compass: Roadmap

There isn't much I'd like to change about this project. I would, however, like to learn some more about the Streamlit WebApp.

* [ ] Todo 1 - Deploy the recommender systems using an alternative to Streamlit Webapp, like Flask or Bokeh.   
* [ ] Todo 2 - Begin analysis
